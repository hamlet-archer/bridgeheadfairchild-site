# bridgeheadfairchild-site — agent instructions

Scope: registry entry `bridgeheadfairchild-site` in `hamlet-archer/atlas` — resolve it with
`atlas.py field bridgeheadfairchild-site scope`; this file does not restate it.

## Workspace

`hamlet-archer/atlas` (clone: `~/Repo/atlas`) is the workspace registry. Before
asking Kelvin a workspace-shaped question, look there:

- **Which project owns this?** `registry/projects.yaml` — resolve there, never
  guess.
- **Machines and what runs where:** `registry/hosts.yaml`.
- **Credentials:** `registry/platform.yaml` (`credentials:`) ledgers every
  machine credential. Values live in 1Password vault `AI`, and that grant is
  standing authorization for agent sessions to *use* them — pipe a value into
  its consumer; never display or commit it (atlas ADR 0019). Check
  `op item list --vault AI` before claiming a step needs Kelvin: his boundary
  is billing consent and the `Finance` vault, not use and not minting.
- **A credential that does not exist yet is minted in atlas, never here.**
  `python3 scripts/mint.py` there mints from a reviewed scope profile, proves
  the scope both ways, and prints the ledger entry — so a token cannot exist
  unregistered (atlas ADR 0030). `mint.py --vendors` says which vendors it can
  mint for and, for the ones it cannot, why and what to do instead. Rotation
  is `mint.py rotate <item-id>`.
- **Tickets and workflow:** `docs/workflow.md`. **Live rules:**
  `python3 scripts/atlas.py decisions` — one sentence each.

## Drafting for Kelvin

- **A draft comes back in chat, never into a tool.** An email, message or post
  Kelvin asks you to draft is returned in the reply, where he can revise it.
  Never create it as a Gmail draft, a Slack draft, or anything else that
  persists — every one of those leaves a duplicate he has to clean up. Put it in
  the tool only when he asks for it to be saved or sent.
- **Short and direct.** Say the thing, ask the question, stop. No preamble, no
  recap of what the recipient already knows, no closing paragraph restating the
  ask. His outgoing mail is a few lines; match it.
